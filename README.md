# jeryu-intelligence

Codegraph, RustJet, MCP intelligence, review, and autonomy analysis.

This repository was seeded from Jeryu source commit `cbecf7caa0e932c76a341b2521e66e911233860d` by
`ops/split/materialize.py`. It is part of the seven-repo Jeryu split family and keeps source
paths stable where practical so ownership remains auditable.
