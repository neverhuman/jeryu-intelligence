# Testing

Run `bash scripts/ci-local.sh` without arguments for the existing
`just fast` then `just check` loop. Exactly
`bash scripts/ci-local.sh required` runs `ops/ci/pr-ci.sh` from this
component root and preserves its exit status. Unknown or extra arguments fail
before any lane runs. Required dispatch does not itself qualify every retained
proof; the full wrapper and separate capability lanes must actually pass.

Use the local CI entrypoints before pushing changes:

- `just fast`
- `just check`
- `just score`
- `just security`
- `just artifact-support`

`scripts/ci-doctor.sh` checks the required local tools.

Agent-readable exception guidance:

- purpose: every typed error documents the caller-facing failure purpose
- reason: failures preserve enough context for local diagnosis
- common fixes: map repeated failures to a small set of operator repairs
- docs_url: point users to this file or a narrower runbook
- repair_hint: state the next command or config change to try

Cost and bounded-operation policy: budget, quota, spend cap, kill switch, and
stop condition evidence must be added before introducing paid or unbounded
network operations.
